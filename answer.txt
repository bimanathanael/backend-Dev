Parallel and Concurrency
Parallel on computer programming is like doing 2 things together. 
For example we can texting while laying on the bed.

Concurrency on computer programming is like doung 2 different things base on orders.
For example we cannot singing while we eating, we need to finish eating first 
then we can singing.
BUT in computer programming, concurrency could be done. Its like asking your team-mate
to singing while you eating.

Parallel can be done on some tasks which can go together wihtout our team-mate help.
Concurrency can be done on some tasks which need out team-mate help to do it.
